## ✨ Who are we?

We own the website [ADOFAI.gg](https://adofai.gg) and our [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/TKdpbUUfUa)!

We're the ones who **push and help the modding scene** of the game [A Dance of Fire and Ice](https://store.steampowered.com/app/977950/A_Dance_of_Fire_and_Ice)!

We are a **non-profit, 100% community driven project** with an ambitious goal of making our community the better place for everyone.
